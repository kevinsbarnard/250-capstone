    "\n",
    "For this project, we created a system that is able to locate points in 2D space using three accelerometers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The procedure of the system goes as follows:\n",
    "1. A user holds down a button and then taps somewhere on a 1 meter by 1 meter sized board.\n",
    "2. The three accelerometers detect different time-dependent signals.\n",
    "3. An algorithm performs autocorrelation between the pairs of signals to determine the time difference of arrival (TDOA) between the pairs of accelerometers.\n",
    "4. Based on the two measured TDOAs, the cartesian point (x, y) is calculated.\n",
    "5. The point is compared to defined regions of the board to see which region it belongs to, and the point is displayed.\n",
    "6. The function associated with the respective region is performed, and output to the console."

    "\n",
    "    When the button is pressed down, defined Acclerometer objects read data into their own python lists. The collected acceleration magnitude data is then returned as numpy arrays for processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Process data\n",
    "\n",
    "    When the data is returned as numpy arrays, the autocorrelation algorithm determines the TDOA between pairs of accelerometers. These two TDOAs are passed into a hyperbolic location algorithm, which converts the TDOAs into a scaled Cartesian point in 2D space.\n",

    "\n",
    "3. Display data\n",
    "\n",
    "    The calculated point will be shown in a matplotlib 2D plot for rough validation, and the activated region will be displayed.\n",

    "\n",
    "4. Interpret data\n",

    "    Finally, the activated region will perform a pre-defined function. In the case of the calculator layout, these regions will be numbers, operations, and an equals sign. The result will then be output to the console.\n",
